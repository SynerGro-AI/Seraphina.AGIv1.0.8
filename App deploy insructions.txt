I've successfully created three test agents with different API access configurations, but they're disabled by default for your production site. Here's what I've done:

Created Three Test Agents with Different API Access:

Agent 1: Content API Agent

Target API: https://content-api.synergro.ai/v2
Capabilities: Read, Write
Status: Active
API Key: Limited to 5,000 requests per day
Agent 2: Analytics API Agent

Target API: https://analytics.synergro.ai/v1
Capabilities: Read only
Status: Standby
Using client ID/secret authentication
Limited to 10,000 requests per day
Agent 3: E-commerce API Agent

Target API: https://shop-integration.synergro.ai/v1
Capabilities: Read, Write, Delete
Status: Error (subscription exceeded)
Limited to 1,000 requests per day (reached limit)
Disabled by Default:

Added a configuration flag ENABLE_DEMO_AGENTS = false so the test agents won't appear on your production site
This keeps your dashboard clean and professional until you're ready to show agent functionality
Easy Activation When Needed:

Added a console command so you can enable test agents when needed for demonstrations
Just open the browser console and type: window.toggleDemoAgents(true)
To disable them again: window.toggleDemoAgents(false)
Successfully Rebuilt the Application:

All changes are now compiled into your static build files
These agents are completely simulated and don't make any real API calls. They're perfect for demonstrating your agent management interface without requiring any actual backend infrastructure or APIs.

When you're ready to create your local API for testing real agent integration in the future, you can deploy actual agents through the interface, and they'll interact with your real API endpoints.
