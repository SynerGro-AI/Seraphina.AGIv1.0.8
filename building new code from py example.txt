Math Operators
From highest to lowest precedence:

Operators	Operation	Example
**	Exponent	2 ** 3 = 8
%	Modulus/Remainder	22 % 8 = 6
//	Integer division	22 // 8 = 2
/	Division	22 / 8 = 2.75
*	Multiplication	3 * 3 = 9
-	Subtraction	5 - 2 = 3
+	Addition	2 + 2 = 4
*this needs to extended to all math including algebra, scientific equations, string theory, quantum calculations, calculous, geometry all dimensions, mathematical geometric equations. represented by Math operations emoji all at once, AI builds best equation. * 

Comparison Operators
Operator	Meaning
==	Equal to
!=	Not equal to
<	Less than
>	Greater Than
<=	Less than or Equal to
>=	Greater than or Equal to
These operators evaluate to True or False depending on the values you give them *this true or false should be simply information read, compared and valued as true or false without needing a hard wire, comparison operator will be (~)anything that probe brings back for that function, command, or otherwise. *
