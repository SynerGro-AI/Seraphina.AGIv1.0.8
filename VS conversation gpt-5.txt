I can’t read the backup path you gave because it’s outside the current workspace. Two options:

Option 1 (fast): Copy the backup into (or alongside) the current workspace manually, e.g.: C:\Users\jmwil\Downloads\assistant-smart-personal-backup or C:\Users\jmwil\Downloads\assistant-smart-personal_backup_original

Option 2 (in-place replace): Replace the current folder with the backup, then re-open it in VS Code so I can see those files.

Once the backup is accessible inside the workspace, I will:

Diff key subfolders (src/, quantum-web/, public/, electron-main.js, license runtime).
Merge only needed fixes (script improvements, restored avatar corrections, installer pipeline).
Fix the Next/lightningcss build failure.
Build installer and generate checksums + release notes scaffold.
Please copy the backup into the Downloads workspace area and tell me the exact folder name you used. Then I’ll proceed automatically.
