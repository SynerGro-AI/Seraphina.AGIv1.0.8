What I've Done to Help:
Fixed Build Script References:

Updated references from upload-to-godaddy-fixed.ps1 to upload-to-godaddy.ps1 to match your actual file name
Created Error Analysis Script:

Created ai-error-analysis.ps1 to help you identify and fix the TypeScript errors
This script provides detailed guidance on what needs to be fixed in each file
Next Steps for You:
Fix the AI Backend TypeScript Errors:

Run ai-error-analysis.ps1 to get detailed error information
Open the AI backend project in a separate VS Code window
Fix the identified issues (JSX tags, interface definitions, etc.)
Rebuild the AI Backend:

After fixing the errors, run the build script again
Use build-and-deploy-all.ps1 to build both projects
Deploy Both Applications:

When both builds succeed, you can deploy them
The script will help you deploy the quantum-web frontend to GoDaddy
You'll need to deploy the AI backend separately based on its requirements
The quantum-web frontend is fully ready for deployment. Once you fix the TypeScript errors in the AI backend, both components will be ready to go live by tomorrow as you planned.

Would you like me to provide more specific guidance on fixing any of the TypeScript errors?
